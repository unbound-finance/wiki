# Conclusion

â€ŒUnbound is the next logical step in the evolution of Decentralized Finance. The platform enables the unlocking of LPTs to be used as collateral for minting Unbound's UND stablecoin. UND, being a stablecoin, has unlimited use cases. The platform, importantly, does not have a liquidation engine which provides a much-needed protection against liquidation of user collateral caused by extreme market volatility. It also issues its native UNB token to users who are providing liquidity, granting them voting rights. These votes can be used to bring about changes and to have a say in the future direction of the Unbound platform
