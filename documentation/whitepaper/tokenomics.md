## Fee Distribution\*

‌The fees collected from minting is broken down as follows:

a) SAFU Fund (40%)\
b) UND Liquidity Pool (40%)\
c) Team Fund (20%)&#x20;

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2021-12-21 at 12.56.22 PM.png>)

SAFU Fund and Liquidity Pools (Earn) are covered in the earlier sections.

**Team Fund**

‌20% of the fees are distributed to team members to enable further development. This allocation is not fixed and as the system becomes more autonomous, the portion allocated can go up or down as required.
