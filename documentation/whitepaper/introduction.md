# Introduction

Unbound is a Decentralized Finance \(DeFi\) platform that works on the derivative layer of Automated Market Makers \(AMMs\). Unbound enables users to unlock liquidity from other platforms such as Uniswap, Balancer, Curve, etc. The platform provides synthetic assets such as UND, a USD pegged decentralized stablecoin, uETH an Ethereum pegged erc20, and other synthetic assets that have Liquidity Pool Tokens \(LPTs\) as collateral.  


Some of the key features and objectives of Unbound are to:

* Provide a debt-free liquidity provision system.
* Unlock liquidity from existing AMM pools.
* Create UND \(a USD-pegged decentralized stablecoin\) and other synthetic digital assets.
* Be a treasury for LPTs
* Solve the problem of loan liquidations
* Establish LPT’s as an improved collateral

### What is DeFi?

‌Decentralized Finance \(DeFi\) is a financial system built on decentralized assets. The DeFi ecosystem comprises lending and borrowing, decentralized exchanges, and derivatives trading among other facilities.   


The DeFi market consists of many innovations such as:  


* Lending Platforms - Compound, Aave, dYdX, Oasis, MakerDAO, Dharma etc.
* Decentralized Exchanges \(DEX\) - Uniswap, EtherDelta, Bancor.
* Assets – Digital assets such as WBTC, RenBTC etc.
* Derivatives - Dai, Synthetix etc.
* Payments – Platforms such as Flexa \(Ethereum\) and the Lightning Network \(Bitcoin\).

In October 2020, the total value locked in DeFi in USD is $10.71 Bn. Uniswap alone dominates 23% of the market share.

### Automated Market Makers \(AMM\)

‌AMM is an implementation of Decentralized Exchanges \(DEXs\). AMMs replace the existing exchange order-books with a permissionless liquidity pool run by algorithms. In DeFi, the constant flow of liquidity is handled by AMMs. Smart contracts lock tokens in order to provide liquidity which enables token pair exchanges. In return, the users, also called Liquidity Providers, are issued an LPT \(Liquidity Pool Token\) that represents the value they put into the Liquidity Pool.
