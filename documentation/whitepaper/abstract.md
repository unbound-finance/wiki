# Abstract

Building the next money lego through unlocking the TVL \(Total Value Locked\) within the DeFi system.

Unbound sets out to solve the following problems:

* Locked liquidity contained in AMM pools  
* High demand but lack of options for a decentralized stablecoin
* Users having their collateral liquidated due to extreme price wicks caused by market volatility 

This white paper is a summary and an explanation of how Unbound Finance solves these problems in a decentralized, trustless and secure manner.
