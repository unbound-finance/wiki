# Unbound - The DeFi Treasury For Liquidity Pool Tokens

Unbound is a DeFi platform that creates a treasury layer on top of existing AMM platforms by leveraging liquidity pools of Automated Market Makers. Unbound provides crypto users the first-ever debt-free liquidity provision system.

Key highlights of Unbound protocol are as follows :

* Debt - free : Borrowed funds are interest free creating a no debt position for users.
* Liquidation - free : Unbound does not have a liquidation Engine. As such users are free from the risk of their collateral being liquidated.
* Perpetual borrowing : Unbound loans do not mature. Users can unlock the underlying collateral at any time by repaying the loan.
* Stablecoin UND : UND is a cross-chain stablecoin, soft pegged to the US dollar which does not need to be stabilised.
* Factory Smart Contracts : Unbound uses Liquidity Lock contracts designed to be permissionless and supports EVM based AMMs like Uniswap, Balancer, Mooniswap, DFYN, SushiSwap etc. Support for Non-EVM based AMMs will be launched soon.
* Minting cross chain synthetic assets : Unbound will make use of oracles and native bridges to perform cross chain transfers of UND and other synthetic assets.
* Secured Price Oracles : Unbound uses a combination of Uniswapâ€™s TWAP and Chainlink to obtain highly secured price feed providing security to the platform against flash attacks and also reduces dependency on a single price oracle.
