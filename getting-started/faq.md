# FAQ

### **What is Unbound.Finance?**

Unbound**.**Finance provides the Unbound protocol used to mint token pairs locked in an LPT smart contract. We collateralize the LPT tokens like UNI-V2 to give you a token pair from our funds.

### **How is this beneficial to users?**

Extra liquidity is always helpful and you are free to invest in the assets of your choice. When you deposit your LPT, you can get funds that you need while keeping your digital assets at the same time as long as the funds are paid back. This is a form of collateralized financing.

### What are Liquidity Pool Tokens\(LPT\)?

When a participant provides liquidity to an AMM exchange like Uniswap, they get ERC20 tokens in return that signifies their investment's contribution in the pool. These tokens are transferable like any ERC20 token and referred to as **Liquidity Pool Tokens** or **LPT**.

### How do you make money on the platform?

Users who choose to participate in liquidity will get a portion of the transactions from the Unbound pool.

### Is the platform decentralized?

Yes, Unbound was built on top of the Ethereum blockchain which is a decentralized network. Your assets are locked in a smart contract that we have no control over. We will be shortly launching a DAO to completely decentralize further development to the community.

### Does the platform liquidate digital assets automatically?

**NO, YOUR ASSETS WILL NEVER BE LIQUIDATED**. We do not have a liquidation engine and until you are able to repay the minted funds you can always get your assets back. We do not liquidate them, but keep them stored in a Vault which we do not have control over. The only time the assets can be liquidated is when the minted funds from Unbound are paid back.
