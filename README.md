# Introduction

### **Welcome To Unbound.Finance**

Unbound is a decentralized non-custodial protocol for unlocking liquidity from AMM pools. We open and create new avenues for earnings and investments without affecting your existing liquidity pools. At the same time we provide a platform to manage the risk involved with collateralized digital assets. With our factory smart contract, we support Uniswap, Balancer, Mooniswap and  Bancor. Support for more protocols are coming soon as we expand our offerings.
